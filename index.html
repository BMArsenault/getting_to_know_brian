                <h2>A little bit about me!</h2>
                <p>My name is Brian Arsenault.  You're probably wondering why I've got a picture of Fenway Park on my page.  I spent the first 32 years of my life growing up in Connecticut so I am a HUGE Red Sox fan.  I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, CT.  I have worked all types of jobs throughout my life but my most memorable one was with a company called Nutmeg Exhibits as a project manager.  This job made me bring out my creativity in helping to design some of the most complex ideas and bring them to life.  After 9 years of that, my wife and I decided to pack up and move across the country to AZ.  I had a job as a project manager position for a steel fabricating company but left that as my wife and I introduced our first child.  I got into coding bootcamp in hopes to turn my creative ideas into a career that will let me showcase my skills to an employer.</p>

                <p>Currently, I do not have any of my own applications to enter into this section.  As I complete applications on my own, I will continue to add them.</p>
