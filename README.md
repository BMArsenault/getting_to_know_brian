# Brian's Portfolio

## Purpose

I have started a portfolio for myself to show off my accomplishments.  Unforunately, I do not have any of my own work to add to this at the moment so I have added the boot camp projects as placeholders.  I will replace each placeholder with my own work as I complete a new one.
